Hereâ€™s a README file of my project, 

Hospital Management System
Welcome to my Hospital Management System project! ðŸš€
This is a microservices-based application built to manage patients, doctors, and appointments. It also features a clean and user-friendly frontend interface. 
The project is completely containerized using Docker Compose for ease of deployment.

What This Project Does
Patient Management: Add, update, and view patient details.
Doctor Management: Manage doctor profiles and specialties.
Appointment Scheduling: Easily schedule and manage appointments.
Frontend Interface: All interactions happen through a user-friendly web interface.
Services
Hereâ€™s how everything is organized:

Service	Port	What It Does
Patient Service	5003	Handles all patient data.
Doctor Service	5001	Manages doctor details.
Appointment Service	5002	Handles appointments and schedules.
Frontend	5000	User interface for the system.
All services communicate seamlessly through a custom Docker network named hospital-network.

Why I Built This
This project demonstrates how a microservices architecture can simplify the management of complex systems like hospitals. 
Each service is independent but works together, making the system scalable and maintainable.

How to Run It
You only need Docker and Docker Compose installed. Follow these steps:

Clone the repository:


git clone <repository_url>  
cd <repository_directory>  
Start the application:


docker-compose up --build  
Open your browser:

Frontend: http://localhost:5000
Patient Service: http://localhost:5003
Doctor Service: http://localhost:5001
Appointment Service: http://localhost:5002
Stopping the Project
To stop all the running services, use:


docker-compose down  
Directory Structure

â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml       # Docker Compose file  
â”œâ”€â”€ patient-service/         # Code for Patient Service  
â”œâ”€â”€ doctor-service/          # Code for Doctor Service  
â”œâ”€â”€ appointment-service/     # Code for Appointment Service  
â””â”€â”€ frontend/                # Code for Frontend  
Whatâ€™s Next?
I plan to:

Add authentication for secure access.
Integrate a database for persistent data storage.
Enhance the frontend with modern UI frameworks.
